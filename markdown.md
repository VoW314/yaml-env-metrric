# NASIM YAML GRADER

-------------------------------------

## Class 

The ["Hardness Class"](https://github.com/VoW314/yaml-env-metrric/blob/main/hardness_class.py)takes in a .yaml file and reads it in for grading. It currently just does one file at a time. The code creates a grade based off the values within the topology of the 2D array. It does require that the headers of each dictionary are properly written but the order of parts of the file does not matter.
